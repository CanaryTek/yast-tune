<H3>IDE DMA mode</H3>

<P>Some IDE devices are broken and they do not work properly if they have DMA
mode enabled (especially CD-ROM drives). DMA mode is enabled by kernel after
boot, but it can be changed by init script. This YaST2 module is frontend for
hdparm utility. There is init script which sets DMA mode after boot.
</P>


<H3>Module description</H3>

<P>
In this YaST2 module DMA mode of selected device
can be enabled or disabled.</P>

<P>Features of YaST2 module are available <A HREF="idedma_features.txt">here</A>.</P>

<P>Settings are stored in file /etc/sysconfig/hardware. There are variables DEVICES_FORCE_IDE_DMA_ON and
DEVICES_FORCE_IDE_DMA_OFF with list of devices (e.g. "hdc hdd") on which DMA will be
enabled/disabled. Other devices have their DMA mode unchanged.</P>


<H3>Workflow</H3>

<P>IDE DMA configuration module has only one dialog.</P>

contains DMA value which will be set after 'Finish' button is pressed and
after boot by init script (on, off, no change). Next columns contain device
information, in the last column is current DMA setup.</P>

<P>To change DMA mode status select device in the table and push a button
below the table with required DMA status.</P>
